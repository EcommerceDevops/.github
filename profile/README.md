# EcommerceDevops: A Production-Grade Microservices Platform

Welcome to the **EcommerceDevops** organization! This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of a modern, secure, and highly automated platform designed to run a cloud-native e-commerce application. The architecture and tooling reflect a deep understanding of today's leading DevOps, GitOps, and DevSecOps principles.

The base application code for the microservices can be found at `https://github.com/SelimHorri/ecommerce-microservice-backend-app/`.

The core objective is to demonstrate mastery in building and maintaining scalable, resilient, and cost-efficient infrastructure, with a strong emphasis on automation at every stage of the software development lifecycle

## Core Pillars & Philosophy

This project is built upon several key pillars that represent the best practices in modern cloud infrastructure management.

### 1. GitOps & Declarative Deployments

The entire system operates on a GitOps model, where Git is the single source of truth for both application and infrastructure configuration.

- **Deployment Strategy:** Implemented advanced **Canary Deployments** using **Argo Rollouts**, allowing for progressive delivery, risk mitigation, and automated rollbacks based on real-time metrics.
- **Declarative Management:** Utilized **Helm** for templating Kubernetes manifests and **Helmfile** for a declarative, environment-aware approach to managing Helm releases. This ensures that our deployments are version-controlled, repeatable, and easily auditable.
- **Automation Agents:** Leveraged a hybrid CI/CD model with **GitHub Actions** for event-driven workflows (e.g., CI, security scanning) and a **Jenkins** server for more complex orchestration tasks, demonstrating flexibility across different automation tools.

### 2. DevSecOps: Security as Code

Security is not an afterthought but is deeply integrated into every layer of the platform and automated within the CI/CD pipelines.

- **Infrastructure & Image Security:**
  - Continuous vulnerability scanning of Kubernetes clusters in production using **Trivy Operator**.
  - Automated static code analysis and Docker image scanning with the **Trivy Action** integrated directly into the CI pipeline, preventing vulnerable code or images from reaching production.
  - Secrets Management: Deployed a highly available **HashiCorp Vault** cluster (master-worker model) for centralized secrets and certificate management. The cluster's sealing status is managed securely and automatically using **Google Cloud KMS**.
- **Secure Registries:** All container images and artifacts are stored in a **Private Artifact Registry**, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring a trusted software supply chain.
- **Access Control:**
  - Implemented strict **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** policies within Kubernetes to govern access to cluster resources. Adhered to the **Principle of Least Privilege** for all cloud resources by creating fine-grained **IAM Policies** and Service Accounts for both human and machine access.

### 3. Advanced Observability

A comprehensive, multi-layered observability stack is in place to provide deep insights into system health, performance, and business metrics.

- **Metrics & Monitoring:** A robust monitoring solution built with **Prometheus** (using the `kube-prometheus-stack` for seamless Kubernetes integration) and visualized with **Grafana**. Centralized Logging:** Deployed the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for powerful log aggregation and analysis, complemented by **Filebeat** as a lightweight log shipper on all nodes. Distributed Tracing & Service Mesh:** Utilized **Linkerd** as a service mesh to provide automatic mTLS, traffic shifting, and critical observability features like golden metrics (success rate, requests, and latency) and distributed tracing. 4. Resiliency & High Availability

### 4. Resiliency & High Availability

The platform is engineered to withstand failures and maintain high availability through proactive testing and resilient design patterns.

- **Chaos Engineering:** Proactively test system resilience using **Chaos Mesh**. designed to simulate failures at various levels, including hardware, network, and Kubernetes pods, to identify and fix weaknesses before they impact users. Multi-Cloud Strategy:** The infrastructure is deployed across **GCP, AWS, and Azure**, providing redundancy and preventing vendor lock-in. is a core component of our disaster recovery plan.
- **State Management:** Terraform state is securely managed in a versioned **Amazon S3 bucket** with native lock files, ensuring consistency and safe collaboration without relying on DynamoDB.

### 5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & Automation

Automation is the foundation of this platform, from infrastructure provisioning to application deployment and environment management.

- **Modular Terraform:** Infrastructure is defined using a highly **modular Terraform** structure. promotes reusability, simplifies maintenance, and allows for consistent environment creation.
- **Environment Separation:** Managed distinct environments (dev, stage, prod) using **Terraform Workspaces**. 's configuration is isolated through dedicated `.tfvars` and `.env` files, all managed from a centralized repository.
- **Orchestration Scripting:** Advanced **Bash scripting** is used to orchestrate complex infrastructure workflows, tying together various tools and automating operational tasks that fall outside the scope of IaC tools.

### 6. Performance at Scale

The architecture is designed for high performance and can scale dynamically to meet demand, with a strong focus on performance testing.

- **Comprehensive Performance Testing:** Implemented a robust performance testing suite using **Locust**. stress tests, load tests, spike tests, and endurance tests to fully understand system behavior under pressure.
- **Dynamic Scaling for Testing:** Leveraged **KEDA (Kubernetes-based Event-driven Autoscaling)** to dynamically deploy and scale performance-testing worker nodes based on demand, enabling efficient and powerful load generation without maintaining a large, idle testing infrastructure. Application Architecture:** The application itself consists of **Spring Boot microservices** using **Spring Cloud with Netflix Eureka** for service discovery, a pattern proven for building scalable and resilient systems.

## Alignment with Modern DevOps Role Requirements

This project directly demonstrates the skills and experience required for a DevOps role by addressing key responsibilities:

- **Design, implement, and maintain scalable infrastructure:** The entire platform is built on a scalable, multi-cloud Kubernetes foundation using a modular Terraform codebase.
- **Automate deployments and CI/CD pipelines:** End-to-end CI/CD pipelines are built with GitHub Actions and Jenkins, featuring automated testing, security scanning, and advanced canary deployments with Argo Rollouts.
- **Manage cloud resources (GCP, AWS, Azure):** Successfully deployed and managed infrastructure across three major cloud providers, with a focus on security and best practices like IAM and resource separation between accounts.
- **Implement monitoring, alerting, and logging solutions:** A robust observability stack with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK provides deep visibility into system health and performance.
- **Ensure infrastructure is secure, compliant, and aligned with best practices:** A "DevSecOps" approach is central, with integrated security scanning (Trivy), secrets management (Vault), and strict access controls (RBAC, IAM).
- **Develop and maintain disaster recovery plans:** The multi-cloud architecture and proactive resilience testing with Chaos Mesh form the backbone of a comprehensive DR strategy.
- **Optimize development and deployment workflows:** The GitOps model with Argo Rollouts and fully automated pipelines significantly improves efficiency and reduces manual intervention.
- **Stay up-to-date with industry trends:** The use of cutting-edge tools like a service mesh (Linkerd), chaos engineering (Chaos Mesh), and event-driven autoscaling (KEDA) proves a commitment to continuous learning and modern practices.
